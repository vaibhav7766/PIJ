# Java Programs Overview

This repository contains three Java programs that demonstrate different functionalities related to array manipulation and conversion.

## Part 1: OddEven.java

This program prompts the user to input a set of numbers, separates them into even and odd categories, and stores them in separate arrays (`even` and `odd`).

## Part 2: Neighbours.java

This program implements a function to find two neighboring numbers in an array with the smallest distance between them. It returns the index of the first number among the neighboring pair.

## Part 3: ArrayAndArrayList.java

This program showcases array manipulation by converting a primitive array of `double` values to an `ArrayList<Double>` and vice versa.

## Program Details

### UserInput.java

This utility class provides a method (`inputArray`) to accept user input for an array of `double` values. The user is prompted to enter array elements separated by spaces.

### ArrayAndArrayList.java

This program demonstrates the conversion of a primitive `double` array to an `ArrayList<Double>` and then back to a primitive array. It uses utility methods from `java.util.Arrays` and `java.util.List` for conversion.

### Neighbours.java

This program includes a function (`findNearestNeighbours`) that calculates the smallest distance between neighboring elements in an array. It iterates through the array to find the neighboring pair with the minimum distance and returns the index of the first element in the pair.

### OddEven.java

This program prompts the user to enter a set of numbers and categorizes them into even and odd numbers, storing them in separate arrays (`even` and `odd`). It demonstrates basic array manipulation based on numeric conditions.

## Usage

To use these programs:

1. Compile the Java files using `javac`:

2. Run each program individually using `java`:

Feel free to explore and modify these programs as needed. Each program is designed to demonstrate specific array-related tasks and can be extended or adapted for broader use cases.
